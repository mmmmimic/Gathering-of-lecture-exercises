    "## Variational Auto-encoders 101\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we will implement a variational auto-encoder (VAE). An auto-encoder encodes some input into a new and usually more compact representation which can be used to reconstruct the input data again. A VAE makes the assumption that the compact representation follows a probabilistic distribution (usually Gaussian) which makes it possible to sample new points and decode them into new data from a trained variational auto-encoder. The \"variational\" part comes from the fact that these models are training through variational inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mathematical details of the training can be a bit challenging. However, we believe that probabilistic deep learning will be an important part of future machine learning, which is why we find it important to introduce the concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "As background material we recommend reading [Tutorial on Variational Autoencoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05908). For the implementation of the model you can read the article \"Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes\", Kingma & Welling, ICLR 2014: http://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.6114v10.pdf and \"Stochastic Backpropagation and Approximate Inference in Deep Generative Models\", Rezende et al, ICML 2014: http://arxiv.org/pdf/1401.4082v3.pdf."

    "\n",
    "Like the simple auto-encoder, VAEs consist of two parts as seen in the figure below where all arrows are non-linear mappings through a neural network. The two parts are the:\n",
    "\n",
    " * **Encoder** (also known as recognition, inference or Q-model): Maps the input data into a probabilistic latent space, z, by defining the mean and variance parameters of a Gaussian distribution as non-linear functions of the input data x like:\n",
    "     - $q(z|x) = \\mathcal{N}(z|\\mu_\\theta(x), \\sigma_\\phi(x))$, which is called the approximate posterior or latent distribution. The parameters $\\mu_\\theta(x)$ (mean) and $\\log \\sigma_\\phi(x)^2$ (log-variance) are outputs from a hidden layer each.\n",
    " * **Decoder** (also known as generative, reconstruction or P-model): Conditioned on samples drawn from $z \\sim q(z|x)$ in the encoder the input data is reconstructed through the: \n",
    "     - $p(x|z)$, which is the conditional likelihood (generative distribution). The choice of the generative distribution depends on the nature of the features, so for binary pixel values an appropiate choice of reconstruction distribution is the [Bernoulli distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_distribution), $p(x|z) = Ber(\\mu_\\phi(z)) = \\mu_\\phi(z)^x(1-\\mu_\\phi(z))^{1-k}$. $\\mu_\\phi(z)$ with $x=\\{0,1\\}$ is again the non-linear output of the last layer in the decoder. $\\mu_\\phi(z)$ is the probabilities of generating a 0 (black) or 1 (white) pixel value, like modelling 784 imbalanced coin-tossing processes. This is only possible because we assume the pixel intensities to be i.i.d. (Independent and Identically Distributed), so no direct correlations between them needs to modelled, even though we still achieve an indirect conditional correlation through the latent variables, z.\n",

This tradeoff is more easily understood through the derivation in the end of the notebook, so read it if you have the time. \n",

The KL-term can calculated analytically and the reconstruction error, $\\log p(x|z)$, is just the binary cross-entropy.\n",

    "### Training a VAE \n",
    "The VAE is similar to a deterministic autoencoder (1.Auto_Encoders) except that we assume that the latent units follows a distribution. Usually we just assume that the units are independent standard normally distributed (i.i.d.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Above we defined a lower bound on the log-likelihood of the data. We can train the model by maximising the lower bound w.r.t. the model parameters, weight matrices, through the stochastic gradient descent algorithm.  Feasible approximations of the expectations in the lower bound, $\\mathcal{L}(x)$, are obtained by evaluating the inside with samples drawn from the latent distribution, $z \\sim q(z|x) = \\mathcal{N}(z|\\mu_\\theta(x), \\sigma_\\phi(x)I)$ and dividing by the number of samples drawn. By using the _reparameterization trick_, $ \\mu_\\theta(x) + \\sigma_\\phi(x) \\cdot \\epsilon$, for the sampling procedure we can directly backpropogate gradients through the latent bottleneck and optimize the parameters w.r.t. the lower bound.

At $KL[q(z|x)||p(z)] = 0$ variations in x stops having an affect on the latent distribution and latent units are all described by the same distribution, $\\mathcal{N}(z|0,I)$, so they produce a noisy output without signal $z=\\epsilon$ to the decoder.\n",
