# exercise 1.5.1
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Load the Iris csv data using the Pandas library
filename = '../Data/iris.csv'
df = pd.read_csv(filename)

# Pandas returns a dataframe, (df) which could be used for handling the data.
# We will however convert the dataframe to numpy arrays for this course as 
# is also described in the table in the exercise
# raw_data = df.get_values() 
raw_data = df.values


# Notice that raw_data both contains the information we want to store in an array
# X (the sepal and petal dimensions) and the information that we wish to store 
# in y (the class labels, that is the iris species).

# We start by making the data matrix X by indexing into data.
# We know that the attributes are stored in the four columns from inspecting 
# the file.
cols = range(0, 4) 
X = raw_data[:, cols]

# We can extract the attribute names that came from the header of the csv
attributeNames = np.asarray(df.columns[cols])

# Before we can store the class index, we need to convert the strings that
# specify the class of a given object to a numerical value. We start by 
# extracting the strings for each sample from the raw data loaded from the csv:
classLabels = raw_data[:,-1] # -1 takes the last column
# Then determine which classes are in the data by finding the set of 
# unique class labels 
classNames = np.unique(classLabels)

# We can assign each type of Iris class with a number by making a
# Python dictionary as so:
classDict = dict(zip(classNames,range(len(classNames))))

# The function zip simply "zips" togetter the classNames with an integer,
# like a zipper on a jacket. 
# For instance, you could zip a list ['A', 'B', 'C'] with ['D', 'E', 'F'] to
# get the pairs ('A','D'), ('B', 'E'), and ('C', 'F'). 
# A Python dictionary is a data object that stores pairs of a key with a value. 
# This means that when you call a dictionary with a given key, you 
# get the stored corresponding value. Try highlighting classDict and press F9.
# You'll see that the first (key, value)-pair is ('Iris-setosa', 0). 
# If you look up in the dictionary classDict with the value 'Iris-setosa', 
# you will get the value 0. Try it with classDict['Iris-setosa']

# With the dictionary, we can look up each data objects class label (the string)
# in the dictionary, and determine which numerical value that object is 
# assigned. This is the class index vector y:
y = np.array([classDict[cl] for cl in classLabels])
# In the above, we have used the concept of "list comprehension", which
# is a compact way of performing some operations on a list or array.
# You could read the line  "For each class label (cl) in the array of 
# class labels (classLabels), use the class label (cl) as the key and look up
# in the class dictionary (classDict). Store the result for each class label
# as an element in a list (because of the brackets []). Finally, convert the 
# list to a numpy array". 
# Try running this to get a feel for the operation: 
# list = [0,1,2]
# new_list = [element+10 for element in list]

# We can determine the number of data objects and number of attributes using 
# the shape of X
N, M = X.shape

# Finally, the last variable that we need to have the dataset in the 
# "standard representation" for the course, is the number of classes, C:
C = len(classNames)
